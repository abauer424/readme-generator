# README Generator

## Description 

For this assignment, our task was to modularize our code into multiple files and use ES6 concepts to build a README generator. For this project I used Node Package Manager to initialize the project and install/import Node.js modules. Additionally I used generate markdown in  the command line to create the README_Generator.md file. 

This problem solved creating a README file by allowing the user to answer a few questions. It transformed the process into an efficent, clean MD document.  

I learned and enjoyed using the integrated terminal to test my code and see what needs fixing and what works along the way.

## Installation

To install the project, you need to use git clone and git pull from <a href ="https://github.com/abauer424/readme-generator">my repository.</a> After cloning its important to download NODE to your computer as well as inquirer. 


## Usage 

When opening the repository, the user will navigate in the terminal to the develop folder by typing "cd Deveop". Once here, the user will type in the terminal "node index.js", this allows the user to create their generated README file. Once this is entered in the terminal the user will be asked a series of questions.
