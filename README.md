# README Generator

## Description 

For this assignment, our task was to modularize our code into multiple files and use ES6 concepts to build a README generator. For this project I used Node Package Manager to initialize the project and install/import Node.js modules. Additionally I used generate markdown in  the command line to create the README_Generator.md file. 

This problem solved creating a README file by allowing the user to answer a few questions. It transformed the process into an efficent, clean MD document.  

I learned and enjoyed using the integrated terminal to test my code and see what needs fixing and what works along the way.
